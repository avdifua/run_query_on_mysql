# run_query_on_mysql
Simple script for executing queries on MySql on localhost with saving the output in .csv file.

Required two files. File with credentials in .ini format. And file with queries.

In this case, the script adapted for getting output from command: show processlist;. 

But the script is very simple to adapt for executing different queries.
